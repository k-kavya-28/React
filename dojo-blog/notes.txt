components - navbar, article, sidebar
html - jsx
class reserved word in javascript so can't use in jsx
component tree
sfc snippet - stateless functional component
/creat for routing
app.js is the root component
app.css apply styles to all the components(js files) as it is put on the top of the webpage
single css file for small projects , it is imported in index.js file
* targeting every element with asterisk
camel case is used in jsx emplate
inline styling - dynamic value which is an object - key value pair
events - hover, click, form submission, scroll 
parenthesis invoke the function
concatenation can be used
default parameter is event for any function we can play with its properties
state of components, data could be variable like boolean or array in a component
react doesnt render any change in the variable - for this we use useState hook, helps us to make a reactive value
chrome react developer tools - component tree 
outputting list - array - using hook - object - keyvalue pair - return only template not hardcode - map method
props - common component example blog list - data used, so props are used to transfer data from one component to another component(parent component to child one) - increases reusability , reusing the logic
hooks - 
    useState hook - used to make state for a component
    useEffect hook - used to do side effects in our components, runs after every render
useEffect doesn't return anything so it's not stores in const, we can fetch data or do some kind of authentication service
endpoints
[] is empty dependency in useEffect
conditional template , conditional and &&
error - 1) sent by the server 
        2) no connection with the server
useFetch.js is for custom hook - use same logic over and over again
custom hook name needs to start with use else it won't work
useFetch funtion will be the hook itself
React routing - the server sends index.html + js bundle altogether, /contact for contact.js
router package needs to be installed : npm install react-router-dom@6
entire application i.e. all the components need to be inside the Router
Switch makes sure there is only one route at one time 
e-event object
